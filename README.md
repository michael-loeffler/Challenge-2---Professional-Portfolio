# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

This application will serve as my Professional Portfolio, displaying examples of my work via links to deployed applications that I complete throughout the bootcamp. It will also serve a landing page for potential employers to get to know me and have access to my contact information.

I was motivated to create this webpage because it will greatly increase my chances of success when it comes time to launch my job search. That is, I will have a robust application (that I built from the ground up) displaying pertinent information of interest to potential employers, while highlighting my skills. It centralizes all my work into one convenient place for interviewers to review my work easily. 

Through working on this project, on the HTML side, I learned how to embed hyperlinks into images, open hyperlinks in new tabs, create line breaks, and use the strong tag to bold text. 

The CSS side of things is where the majority of my learning took place. The main focus of this project for me was practicing and learning more about flexbox methodology. This was key in visually organizing the page how I wanted it to look, making each image/caption pair the same size (except for the first one which I was supposed to make larger via the Acceptance Criteria), and effectively using the empty space to make everything centered and easy to read. Speaking of readability, another focus of this project and a big sign of progress for me was getting a media query to function correctly in order to reorient the content of the webpage depending on the size of the user's window/device. Other skills that I learned through building this application include: declaring and using CSS variables, removing the bulletpoints from an unordered list (e.g., my nav bar), removing the underline default for hyperlinks (also my nav bar), the object-fit property for images, and finally pseudo-classes like :hover and :first-child. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This webpage features 3 hyperlinks in the navigation bar at the top-right of the page. Clicking on any of these links will bring you directly to the associated section of the page that discusses that topic. There are also hyperlinks embedded in the images for the Study Guide and Code Refactor projects. They will bring you directly to the associated deployed application. This page also features a responsive layout that changes as the user resizes their screen, or visits the page on a mobile device.
